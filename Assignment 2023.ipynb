Galaxies falling in between lines 1 and 2 are called Composites. Galaxies in the upper-right branch can be further subdivided into LINERs and Seyfert using the demarcation line 3, valid only above relation 2.\n",

    "Plot for these galaxies the BPT-NII diagram and draw the demarcation lines. Do you think that, for any galaxy in this sample, you may be incurring in an error in <strong>c)</strong> by using the H$\\alpha$ flux to compute the SFR? Why? If you answered affirmatively, which galaxy(ies) may be affected by such an error?\n",

    "<strong>d)</strong> We should, in principle, use the total SFR from and total stellar mass, but we will make use only of the fiber quantities. Plot the SFR versus total stellar mass in the fiber using blue color for the star-forming galaxies and the others in red. Can you explain the result? Why there seems to have two different sequences? Find the best linear fit to the star-forming galaxies.\n",
