#### <b>RESUME</b>

This repository contains materials related to a course on extragalactic
astronomy, including lecture notes, and one homework assignment.

The repository also includes a Python script for calculating parameters
related to the spectral synthesis and the code FADO
(www.spectralsynthesis.org), which may be useful for other students or
researchers interested in this area of astronomy.

#### <b>ASSESSMENT</b>

The assessment is an IPython notebook titled "Assignment 2023" and is part of
a course on extragalactic astronomy. The notebook is structured into five
sections, each addressing a specific problem or question related to
extragalactic astronomy.

- Section 1 asks the student to generate an artificial star cluster with a
  given Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and plot a histogram of stars as
  a function of mass.

- Section 2 involves computing the time evolution of colors due to the stellar
  populations.

- In section 3, the student is asked to compute the tables and sizes of
  galaxies using photometric values.

- Section 4 involves analysing the FADO spectral synthesis by-products,
  classification of galaxies according to classical diagnostic diagrams using
  optical emission-line ratios.

- Finally, in section 5 we ask the student to give additional thoughts on the
  data just analysed.

Throughout the notebook, the student is asked to provide explanations for
their calculations and interpretations of their results.

The notebook contains detailed instructions and hints for each problem, as
well as example code and links to relevant resources. Overall, the assessment
covers a range of topics in extragalactic astronomy, including stellar
populations, galaxy evolution, and cosmology.
