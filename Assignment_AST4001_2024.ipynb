    "<strong>b)</strong> To explore and better understand these data, we must introduce additional columns in the FITS table CALIFA_data.fits generated in step <strong>a)</strong>. A new column should represent the physical size, measured in kiloparsecs (kpc), corresponding to 3 arcseconds — the extent previously covered by the SDSS fibre. In what follows below, it's crucial to recall that the SDSS fibre spans merely 3 arcseconds and is typically centred on the extended object, such as galaxies in our case. The CALIFA observations, instead, probe a much larger area thanks to the integral field unit that was used: you can add another new column to the FITS table where, for each galaxy, you compute the rough diameter (in kpc) corresponding to the area covered by the PMAS/PPAK IFU observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform these calculations, you can utilize Python and the astropy.cosmology module, specifically the FlatLambdaCDM class. Use the kpc_proper_per_arcmin function to compute the angular separation in arcseconds corresponding to a proper kiloparsec at a given redshift (z). Throughout the calculation, you can adopt the following cosmological parameters: $H0 = 70$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_M = 0.3$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7$, which are typical values for a flat universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>c)</strong> The Petrosian half-light radius in the r-band, denoted as $R_{50}$, measured in arcseconds, provides an approximation of the size of the galaxy. Essentially, $R_{50}$ represents the radius that encompasses half of the light emitted by the galaxy in the specified band. To compute the physical size in kiloparsecs (kpc) assessed via $R_{50}$, we can use the angular diameter distance formula along with the known redshift of each galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have computed the physical size associated with $R_{50}$ for each galaxy, plot the mass-size relation, where the stellar mass ($m_{\\star}$) is plotted against $R_{50}$. Analyse this plot and provide comments on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>d)</strong> Compare the 3 arcseconds projected size and the PMAS/PPAK width, both obtained in step <strong>b)</strong>, with the Petrosian size assessed in step <strong>c)</strong>, and comment on the potential advantages of employing integral field spectroscopy (IFS) over single-fibre spectroscopy (such as the one provided by the SDSS project).\n",

    "<strong>g)</strong> The BPT diagrams (named after \"Baldwin, Phillips & Telervich\") are a set of nebular emission line ratio diagrams used to distinguish the ionization source of gas.
