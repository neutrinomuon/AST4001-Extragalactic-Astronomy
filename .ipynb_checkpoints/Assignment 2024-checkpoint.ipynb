    "<strong>b)</strong> In order to enhance the FITS table CALIFA_MotherSample.fits generated in step <strong>a)</strong>, we must introduce an additional column. This column should represent the physical size, measured in kiloparsecs (kpc), corresponding to 3 arcseconds—the extent covered by the SDSS fiber. It's crucial to consider that the SDSS fiber spans merely 3 arcseconds and is typically centered on the extended object, such as galaxies in our case. Consequently, it's essential to acknowledge that the spatial scale mapped by the SDSS spectrum does not fully encompass the entirety of the galaxy's extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hint:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this calculation, you can utilize Python and the astropy.cosmology module, specifically the FlatLambdaCDM class. Use the kpc_proper_per_arcmin function to compute the angular separation in arcseconds corresponding to a proper kiloparsec at a given redshift (z). Throughout the calculation, you can adopt the following cosmological parameters: $H0 = 70$ km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_M = 0.3$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.7$, which are typical values for a flat universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>c)</strong> The Petrosian half-light radius in the r-band, denoted as $R_{50}$, measured in arcseconds, provides an approximation of the size of the galaxy. Essentially, $R_{50}$ represents the radius that encompasses half of the light emitted by the galaxy in the specified band. To compute the physical size in kiloparsecs (kpc) of $R_{50}$, we can use the angular diameter distance formula along with the known redshift of each galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have computed the physical size of $R_{50}$ for each galaxy, we can plot the mass-size relation, where the stellar mass ($m_{\\star}$) is plotted against $R_{50}$. By analyzing this plot, we can discern any potential correlations between the stellar mass and the size of the galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe a correlation between stellar mass and $R_{50}$, it could imply that more massive galaxies tend to have larger sizes. This correlation might be attributed to various factors, such as the galaxy's formation history, mergers, or environmental influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>d)</strong> After computing the projected size in step <strong>b)</strong> and obtaining the Petrosian size in step <strong>c)</strong>, we can compare these two measurements to assess the potential advantages of employing integral field spectroscopy (IFU) over single-fiber SDSS spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integral field spectroscopy offers several advantages for studying galaxies. Unlike single-fiber spectroscopy, which provides data from a limited region of the galaxy, IFU allows for the simultaneous observation of the entire spatial extent of the galaxy. This comprehensive view enables a deeper understanding of internal structures, dynamics, and spatially resolved properties. With IFU, researchers can investigate spatial variations in properties such as gas kinematics, star formation rates, and metallicity across the galaxy. These insights provide valuable information for understanding the formation and evolution processes of galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The projected size computed in step <strong>b)</strong> represents the physical size of the galaxies based on their redshift and the angular diameter distance formula. On the other hand, the Petrosian size obtained in step <strong>c)</strong> provides an approximation of the galaxy's size based on the radius that contains half of the light emitted by the galaxy in the r-band.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing these two sizes, we can evaluate whether the spatial extent sampled by the single-fiber SDSS spectroscopy adequately captures the entire galaxy or if there are significant portions of the galaxy that remain unobserved. If the Petrosian size significantly exceeds the projected size computed in step <strong>b)</strong>, it suggests that single-fiber spectroscopy might miss important spatial information about the galaxy's outer regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, employing IFU would be justified, as it allows for the simultaneous observation of the entire spatial extent of the galaxy. IFU provides a more comprehensive view of the galaxy's internal structures, dynamics, and spatially resolved properties, including spatial variations in properties such as gas kinematics, star formation rates, and metallicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the Petrosian size is notably larger than the projected size, it indicates that IFU would indeed offer significant advantages over single-fiber SDSS spectroscopy, providing a more complete understanding of the galaxy's properties and evolution."
